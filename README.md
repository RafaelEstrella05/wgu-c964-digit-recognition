## WGU C64 Digit Recognition

This project is a digit recognition application that uses a convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The application uses the MNIST dataset to train the model and then uses the model to predict the digit drawn by the user. The application is built using Python and the PySide6 library for the GUI.



## Python 3.10.12 Dependencies
        tensorflow
        keras
        numpy
        matplotlib
        PySide6
        scipy

## Features
    Security:
    - checks for only 1 digit drawn
    - disregards drawn clusters that are too small
    - checks to make sure canvas is not empty


## Pycharm setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Pycharm
3. Configure the Python interpreter to use Python 3.10+
4. Install all the missing dependencies
5. Run the main.py file

## WGU C64 Digit Recognition

This project is a digit recognition application that uses a convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten digits. The application uses the MNIST dataset to train the model and then uses the model to predict the digit drawn by the user. The application is built using Python and the PySide6 library for the GUI.
